    r"""
    A CUDA-optimized parallel implementation of associative scan that preserves
    the same semantics as the standard associative_scan.

    This implementation currently falls back to the standard associative_scan
    to ensure semantic compatibility. Future versions will implement a
    specialized CUDA parallel algorithm while maintaining the same behavior.

    Args:
        combine_fn (Callable): A binary callable with type ``(Tensor, Tensor) -> Tensor``,
            or if input is a pytree ``(pytree, pytree) -> pytree``.
            This function must be pure, i.e., no lifted arguments are supported at the moment,
            satisfy the associative property and have no side-effects.
        xs (torch.Tensor): The input tensor, or nested pytree of tensors.
            All inputs are expected to have the same shape.
        dim (int): the dimension to scan over
        reverse (bool): A boolean stating if the scan should be reversed with respect to ``dim``, default ``False``.
        combine_mode (str): A string indicating whether the ``combine_fn`` is ``pointwise`` or ``generic``, default ``pointwise``.
            If ``combine_mode=pointwise``, ``combine_fn`` must be pure, may only contain pointwise operations
            and ``xs`` must be CUDA tensors.
            In all other cases ``combine_mode=generic`` should be used.
            Note: ``combine_mode=pointwise`` is more efficient than ``combine_mode=generic``.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The result of the associative scan operation.

    Example::

        def add(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor):
            return x + y

        cumsum = cuda_parallel_associative_scan(add, x, dim)

    .. note::
        This implementation currently falls back to the standard associative_scan
        implementation to ensure semantic compatibility during development.
